#c. For 8.5 find only maximum data points until 10

#9. *Print a vector with the integers between 1 and 100 that are not divisible by 3, 5 and 7
#using filter option.
Filter(function(i) { all(i %% c(3,5,7) != 0) }, seq(100)
       
#10. Generate a sequence backwards of the integers from 1 to 100.
seq (100,1)
#or
numbers <- seq(1:100)

#11. List all the natural numbers below 25 that are multiples of 3 or 5.
#Find the sum of these multiples.

#a. How many data points from 10 to 11?
length(10:11)


#12. Statements can be grouped together using braces ‘{’ and ‘}’. A group of statements
#is sometimes called a block. Single statements are evaluated when a new line is typed at
#the end of the syntactically complete statement. Blocks are not evaluated until a new line is
#entered after the closing brace.
#Enter this statement:
{ x <- 0+ x + 5 + }

#13. *Set up a vector named score, consisting of 72, 86, 92, 63, 88, 89, 91, 92, 75,
#75 and 77. To access individual elements of an atomic vector, one generally uses
#the x[i]construction.
#Find x[2] and x[3]. Write the R code and its output.
score <- c(72, 86, 92, 63, 88, 89, 91, 92, 75, 75, 77)

#14. *Create a vector a = c(1,2,NA,4,NA,6,7).
#a. Change the NA to 999 using the codes print(a,na.print="-999").
a <-c(1,2,NA,4,NA,6,7)
print(a,na.print="-999")

#15. A special type of function calls can appear on the left hand side of the assignment operator as in > 
class(x) <- "foo"
#Follow the codes below:
name = readline(prompt="Input your name: ")
age = readline(prompt="Input your age: ")
print(paste("My name is",name, "and I am",age ,"years old."))
print(R.version.string)
